<h2 class="section-title"> Brief about assignment (250+ words)</h2>
<p>
 It's me Dipesh Pandey, I am very thankful to Mr. Ankit Thapa sir, our Web Development teacher,for his
 guidence and help. He gave me the knowledge I needed to finish this assignment on my own. I also want to 
 thank Nami College for including this creative assignment in our course. Working on
 it was fun and taught me a lot.
 </p>
<p>
The current site report describes the process of my personal portfolio website planning,
design and development as part of the CSY1063 Web Development assignment. The primary objective
of this project was to create and develop professional, simple and original portfolio site with
just HTML and external CSS and no templates, no frameworks, no Bootstrap, no internal CSS or or 
inline styling. This website has been created with the intention of demonstrating my profile,
projects, and contact information in a clear and user-friendly manner with observing all the
assignment rules and marking criteria.
</p>
<p>
The design of this website was kept normal with soft background colors, clean, and balanced
spacing to make the content easy to read and visually comfortable. HTML elements such as 
header, nav, main, section, article, and footer were used to give the website a proper structure
and improve accessbility.CSS Flexbox and Grid were used to handle layout and alignment, and
media queries were added to make sure the website looks responsive on different screen sizes
and devices.
</p>
<p>
During development, I faced challenges such as overlapping elements, alignment problems
image positioning issues, and form layout errors. These issues were solved by carefully
checking the HTML structure and adjusting margins, padding, and display properties in CSS.
This errors helped me to understand the importance of writing clean code, using proper 
indentation, and testing regularly in the browser. Through this project, I improved my 
understanding of HTML structure, external CSS styling, responsive design, and problem-
solving skills. The final result is a simple, original, and professional portfolio website
that meets all the assignment requirements and presents my work in a clear and organised
manner.
